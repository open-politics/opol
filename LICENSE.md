# The Open Politics Project – License

Version 2.0 – Effective 30.03.2025

> ! TLDR: You are free to use, modify & monetise with this software as you please - as long as your stay open source.

## 1. Overview

This license concerns the two fundamental technical components created, developed and distributed by the Open Politics Project.

These are distributed by the Github organisation "open-politics", and namely:

- /open-politics-hq (the app and UX layer)
- /opol (the data layer)

Both are released under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 (AGPLv3).
We also offer an optional Enterprise Self-Hosting License for organizations that need to make private internal modifications without triggering AGPLv3's public-source requirements.

## 2. AGPLv3 License

By default, all code here is licensed under the AGPLv3. In essence:

- You can use, modify, and distribute the software free of charge.
- If you publicly deploy the software (e.g., a hosted service accessible over a network), you must open-source your modifications under the same AGPLv3.
- This ensures that all public-facing derivatives remain open-source.

The complete AGPLv3 text is provided in AGPLv3.txt (or a similarly named file) within this repository.

## 3. Enterprise Self-Hosting License (Optional)

For large organizations that want to keep custom modifications private (i.e., not publicly deployed) and avoid AGPLv3's disclosure requirements:

- Paid Annual Subscription: Grants a temporary exemption from open-sourcing your internal modifications.
- Internal Use Only: If you do not publicly deploy these modifications, you may keep them private while the subscription is active.
- Reversion to AGPLv3: If your subscription lapses or the modifications become publicly accessible, you must release them under AGPLv3.

Contact us at engage@open-politics.org to discuss Enterprise licensing.

## 4. Hosted Webapp (Official Instance)

We also operate an official hosted version of the Open Politics Webapp:

- Free for public-interest users (e.g., NGOs, journalists, students, civic organizations, citizens). 
- Voluntary Paid Contribution for commercial users like consultancies or private think tanks. This is encouraged but not enforced.

Note: Regardless of hosted or self-hosted usage, you bring your own AI API keys (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic) if you wish to enable any LLM-powered features.

## 5. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE OPEN POLITICS PROJECT AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY ASSOCIATED HOSTED SERVICE.

## 6. Acceptance

By using, modifying, or distributing the code in this repository, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to:

- The terms of the AGPLv3 for all public deployments.
- The optional terms of the Enterprise Self-Hosting License if you choose to purchase it.
